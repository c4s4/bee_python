<p>This file is the reference documentation for the Python Bee package.
This package is made of tasks to build your Python projects and templates
to quick start new ones.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Bee packages are managed as Ruby Gems, thus you can install Bee Python
typing <tt>sudo gem install bee_python</tt> under Unix systems or <tt>gem 
install bee_python</tt> under Windows. Note that this will also install Bee
if not already installed because Bee is a required dependency of 
<i>bee_python</i>.</p>

<h2>Python Tasks</h2>

<p>To get a reference about Python tasks, please see 
<a href="tasksreference.html">Tasks Reference</a> section.</p>

<p>You can also get documentation about a given task in a terminal typing
<tt>bee -k python.pylint</tt> for instance. To list all available tasks in
the Python package, type <tt>bee -k python.?</tt>.</p>

<h2>Python Templates</h2>

<p>To get a reference about Python templates, please see 
<a href="templatesreference.html">Templates Reference</a> section.</p>

<p>You can also get documentation about a given template in a terminal typing
<tt>bee -e python.project</tt> for instance. To list all available templates
in the Python package, type <tt>bee -e python.?</tt>.</p>

<p><i>Enjoy!</i></p>
