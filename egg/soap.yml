      This script will create a template project for a Python SOAP server and
      a sample client. Generated build file provides targets 'check' to check
      Python scripts syntax, 'run' to start the server, 'zip' to create
      distribution archive and 'clean' to delete generated files. You must
      install SOAPpy, pconst and PyXML to run this script.
